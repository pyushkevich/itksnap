  Need to make mouse region selection controllable via 'or'able flags:

	> Single cell					(SELECT_CELL)
	> Row of cells (eg. Fl_Browser, Fl_Table_Row)	(SELECT_ROW)
	> Column of cells		      		(SELECT_COL)

  Need finer control of auto-scrolling, based on proximity
  to the table edge, like normal tty scrolling.

> Don't show resize cursor when over header for left edge 
  of cell#0, or top edge of header for row#0.

    Yes, through the configured directories...

    Easy fix: provide your source directories when configuring,
    e.g.:

	./configure --prefix=/usr/local/src/fltk-M.m.p \
	    --includedir=/usr/local/src/fltk-M.m.p

	CONTEXT_DEADZONE_TABLE
	CONTEXT_DEADZONE_HEADER
	CONTEXT_DEADZONE_SCROLLBAR

  Esp for use with fltk container. Also, gets rid of need for
  user to handle those little edge lines in custom widgets

  Try to follow Fl_Browser as closely as possible.
  For keyboard navigation, and probably right-click stiuff
  too to bring up menus.
