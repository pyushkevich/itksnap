ToDo:

- optimize CopySegementationToJdst and CopySegementationToJsrc
-- RMB functionality in JoinCopyFilter

- combine mode 2 with mode 0 and add extra button for "LoadImageToJsrc"
-- restructure JoinDataPanel to have two main buttons: CnJ from Seg. or File OR CnJ from gWS
- add 'n' for next smallest unused label see eg m_Wrapper->GetHistogram(nBins) in ./Logic/ImageWrapper/DisplayMappingPolicy.cxx
- adjust GUI: 
-- text on gWS range: max available but causes recompute
-- gWS move use file/overlay to bottom
- set gWS input only if it changed on prepro. page
- make UnDo for CnJ/gWS possible
- destinguish RMB click from RMB drag (zoom)
- let user choose which color representation should be used for Jsrc
- make GUI parts more fool prove
- add a GUI progress for current stderr progress
- add an invert option for direct mode, see e.g. InvertFunctor in SNAPImageData
- make contrast and LUT adjustment possible for e.g. GWS Source Image
- make it possible to "save" gWS state, e.g. WS regions and hirarchy such that no recomp. is necessary when gWS state is loaded (difficult, possibly not possible)

- add MorphlogicalWS from all Labels into PB, result as overlay
- change "load from file" to "load from overlay" in CnJ and gWS


Done:

-implement JoinCopyFilter (templated over dimension)
-- multi-threaded ImageRegionIterator
