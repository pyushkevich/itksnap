TODOs for GWS:

- add image+layer for adf output
- add 'n' for next smallest unused label see eg m_Wrapper->GetHistogram(nBins) in ./Logic/ImageWrapper/DisplayMappingPolicy.cxx
- make UnDo possible
- add functionality to all buttons, e.g. back
- destinguish RMB click from RMB drag (zoom)
- would be nice to let user choose which color representation should be used for Jsrc
- make GUI parts more fool prove
- add an invert option for direct mode, see e.g. InvertFunctor in SNAPImageData

- add MorphlogicalWS from all Labels into PB and/or CnJ
